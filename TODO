Removed reentrancy guard to instead use correct checks/effects.
100X check if it's done correctly. Fight ptsd

UnityVaults: second check for caller = tx.origin on internal harvest redudant since public harvest has it?

Add ERC4626 take profit vaults. Using Jae's take profit contracts w/ permission.





--------------
Done in UnityVault2:

Consider changing charge fees from sending to treasury/strat/recipient
To sending to a protocol owned contract that splits received funds accordingly & distros.

Pros:
- Easier control over receiving addresses & split changes without cluttering main contract. 
- Cuts 2 transfers and contextual code, making overall harvest cost cheaper.
- Removes some global variables from contract 
- Can set up buyback/distro/pool/bribe infra for the for the future

Cons: A lil operational cost in calling distro in fee contract. Not bad on ftm, can suck on other chains, at starter TVL.
- If immutable and needs changing, must update all feeRecipient addresses in all vauls. Proxy fixes this.


Probably a good idea tho. Will Make second UnityVault version with those changes
